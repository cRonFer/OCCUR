Here is a reproducible example of the processing steps included *OCCUR* to run locally.

The example uses a dataset of occurrence records 'recordsGBIFOCCUR.csv' obtained from GBIF (GBIF.org (16 November 2023) GBIF Occurrence Download https://doi.org/10.15468/dl.u693he)
It contains records of three species of mosses (Homalothecium aureum (Spruce) H.Rob. Syntrichia ruralis (Hedw.) F.Weber & D.Mohr Tortella squarrosa (Brid.)
Limpr.) collected in Portugal and Spain.

To run the example please download the dataset and also the RCode script 'ProcessingOfRecords'.
This example filters records placed in Portugal, for this reason, it will be necessary to download a polygon shapefile (geopackage) of 
Portugal (Go to https://gadm.org/download_country.html set Portugal and download the gpkg file).
